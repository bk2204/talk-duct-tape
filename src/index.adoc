= Duct Tape and the Camel: What I've Learned from Maintenance
brian m. carlson

== Brief Introduction
[%build]

// About me
//   Git (Kerberos), Asciidoctor
//   Perl codebase at cPanel (maintenance and releases)
//   One-shot maintenance

* Polyglot maintenance programmer
* Show of hands: Who's done maintenance work?

// Can be defined as you please

== Maintenance
[%build]

* From (Old) French _maintenir_ (to maintain, stick to, persist, keep up)
** From Latin (to support, hold in the hand)
** French _maintenant_ (now)
* Persistence, yes.
* Keeping up, no.

== Prioritization
[%build]

* You will _always_ have more bugs and work than time.
* Prioritize.
* Let the broken stuff go.
* Better, get rid of it.

== Code Reuse
[%build]

// Make it someone else's problem.

* Reuse existing modules aggressively.
* Better to add small patches than write something new.
* Conversion from custom HTTP client to HTTP::Tiny
** No performance impact
** Automatic redirect support
** Reduced complexity
** Less to worry about

// Conversion had one bug.

== Say “No”
[%build]

* Typical questions:
** Can I merge a 2000-line change for tomorrow's release?
** Can I re-architect this subsystem in the maintenance branch?
** Can you add major new functionality within a week and a half?
* People don't like “no”
** People like it better than the consequences
** Important to set reasonable expectations
** Offer alternatives.

// Not saying “no” to lord power over people, but because the alternative is
// madness.

== Make the Rules the Bad Guy
[%build]

* Clear, articulable rules about what can go in maintenance branches
* Clear limits on how much time can be spent on a task (e.g. 8 hours)
* Clear coding standards
* “I'm sorry, but it doesn't meet these criteria.”

== Make the Tools Do the Work
[%build]

* Set clear perltidy rules
** It's either tidy or it's not.
** Re-tidying
* Set clear perlcritic rules
** Either it passes or it doesn't.
* Codify as much as possible in automated tools.
** Commit message standards.
** cplint
* Avoid arguments about style and coding standards.
* Now the tools are the bad guy.

// Next person to touch rule.

== Say “Yes”
[%build]

* Be willing to make exceptions.
** Can I add a small, non-regression bugfix that's affecting a lot of users?
** Can I add improved error handling in this feature?
* These _are_ exceptions.
** If it becomes a problem, you can always go back to “no.”
** See the rules.

== Send a Patch
[%build]

* Sending even small, trivial patches are a great way to get it done.
* Discussion becomes about the best way to solve the problem, instead of
	_whether_ to solve the problem.
* Makes changes much easier on maintainers.
* Only one bad reaction, ever.

// e.g. zsh, Debian, twofish

== If You Break It, Fix It
[%build]

* You're going to break things.
** Everyone makes mistakes.
** Own up, and fix it right away.
* People care that it's been fixed (and quickly), not who broke it.

// Elevator conversation about Roundcube and git apply.

== Use Your Editor
[%build]

* Examples from Vim
* Syntastic & perlcritic
* :Emod
* Embedded Perl
* Completion

// Emphasize editor is personal choice.
// Embedded Perl for refactoring.

== Communicate
[%build]

* People really like to know what's going on (surprises are bad)
* Be honest and transparent about expectations and timelines
* Give a rationale when possible

== Questions

== Bonus Slides

== Go Beyond the Minimum
[%build]

* Thanks for answering my question; here's a patch for the docs
* Here's how I solved your problem in case you hit it again
* People really appreciate this

// Other examples.  Andy & nursing.

== Make It All Testable
[%build]

* Every script should be a modulino
* Isolate untestable code into functions for mocking
** Service changes
** Network and service interactions

// create-swap
